`go-webserver-demo`
===================

A simple webserver written in Go.

Written while learning Go, investigating some Go features.

The main component is a trivial wiki, written along the lines of the example
given in [Writing Web Applications](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/),
But (semi) deliberately combined with other tutorials, to force me to
think a bit more rather than just blindly copy.

Hard-coded to appear at `http://localhost:8080`.

Pages:

- [top](http://localhost:8080/)
- [wiki Sandbox](http://localhost:8080/wiki/view/SandBox)
- [simple template](http://localhost:8080/simple)
